Activity 2: Data Structures

Set operations include:
Union
Intersection
Difference
Symmetric difference

1. Explain a use for each of these set operations within the context of your summative assessment.
A Set is an unordered collection that is iterable. The biggest advantage of using a set instead of for example a list or an array, is that it is very optimized for checking if a spesific element exist inside the set or not. The reason sets are really good at this is because use the hash map data structure.

A Union would include two different sets in one.
An Intersection would find common elements in both sets.
A Difference would return elements in the first set that don't exist in the second set.
A Symmetric difference would return unique elements in both sets.


2. Write a Python program to carry out a linear search on a list data structure.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

def findElement(e):
    for element in my_list:
        if element == e:
            return e
    
    return -1
