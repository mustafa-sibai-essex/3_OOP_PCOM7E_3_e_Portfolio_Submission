Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC stages are as follows:
1. Requirement gathering and analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation or coding
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

The following UML diagrams are most suited for Requirement gathering and analysis stage:
1. Case diagrams

The following UML diagrams are most suited for Design stage:
1. Class diagrams
2. Activity diagrams
3. State diagram
