HI Zukiswa,

I completely agree with your point that software developers must understand the project requirements first before anything else. Without a solid understanding of the project requirements, the development of the software would go into development hell. I have worked on one or two projects where people in the team did not understand the big picture or what the software they were developing for their client is trying to achieve, which caused many delays and headaches. Redoing work because the requirements were not clear demotivates developers and create bad code and many bugs. Furthermore, as a team, you cannot make the right decisions on which algorithm or design pattern to use if the team does not have a clear idea of what the client wants or is trying to achieve short-term and long-term.

As for documentation, it is crucial that the team starts documenting the software they are developing as early as possible. There are many advantages of having documentation for the software in development, such as if a new member joins the team, they can easily refer to the documentation to understand how the software is architected. Documentation is invaluable for both short-term and long-term projects.
